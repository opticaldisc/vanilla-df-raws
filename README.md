# Dwarf Fortress vanilla raw files mirror

This repo is intended to be a modding resource, allowing you to easily view and compare the raw files of different Dwarf Fortress versions

## What about the modding system and separate modules after v50?

I merge all the vanilla module object dirs into a single dir for each post-v50 release. This simulates the old style of all object files being in a single spot, making it easier to diff against old versions.
